# Wind Turbine Energy Prediction

This repository contains a Flask web application that predicts the energy output of wind turbines based on weather conditions. The application uses a pre-trained machine learning model to make predictions.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

## Setup Instructions

 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
git clone https://github.com/chidupudi/wind-turbine-energy-prediction.git
cd wind-turbine-energy-prediction

2. Create a Virtual Environment

python -m venv venv

3. Install Required Packages

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Set Up VS Code
Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code:

code .

5. Download the Pre-trained Model
Ensure that the pre-trained model file power_prediction.sav is placed in the root directory of the project. You can download this file from your source or training process.

6. Running the Application
To run the Flask application, execute the following command:

python app.py

The application will start, and you can access it at http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your web browser.
